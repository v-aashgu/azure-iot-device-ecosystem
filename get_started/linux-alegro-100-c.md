# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Alegro 100 device running Linux (Debian) with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-Linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Alegro 100 device](https://www.viatech.com/tw/solutions-tw/via-iot-studio/via-alegro-100/)

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   The URL for the device is https://www.viatech.com/tw/solutions-tw/via-iot-studio/via-alegro-100/

-   Install a Debian distribution on the Alegro 100 device.

-   Set up network settings for the device and connect to Debian via SSH.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

    **Debian**

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl uuid-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential cmake git libssl-dev pkg-config cmake-data


-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    **For HTTPS protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdk-c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdk-c/build_all/Linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **If using AMQP protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_Linux (Debian)/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    **If using HTTP protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/cmake/iotsdk_Linux (Debian)/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http

    **If using MQTT protocol:**

        ~/azure-iot-sdk-c/c/cmake/iotsdk_Linux (Debian)/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_mqtt/iothub_client_sample_mqtt

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/Linux
  make -f makefile.Linux all
  ```
